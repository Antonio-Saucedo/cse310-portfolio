# Overview

Hello World is a short program to signify the beginning of a specific coding language learning process.
In my Software Engineering career I have experience with Python and this will be a showcase of the new
things I will learn. I hope to create new software that will challenge me in using new techniques and
expose me to new code that will help in developing a better understanding of best business practices.
I created this to show a starting point in learning more ways to coding with the Python language.

This software was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and the version control system used to
store the software is Github.

The programming language used in this software is Python. An input variable was added to the software to
allow the user to see "Hello World!" output by the software.
